 1) RESOLVED IN R0.1 Schematic zone G4 and G5, blue text claims INJ5 as INJ3, and INJ6 as INJ4
 2) RESOLVED IN R0.1 Schematic inj1 and 2 are flipped, nets are flipped. Change net names and correct blue silk screen note. 
 3) RESOLVED IN R0.1 Add silk screen to designate injector # and similar. 
 4) RESOLVED IN R0.1 Move C26, it's currently under an inductor. 2 parts can not sit in the same physical space
 5) RESOLVED IN R0.1 Add via for battery wire to be attached. 
 6) RESOLVED IN R0.1 check for flipped pins. pins 39 and 50 are wrong.  
 7) RESOLVED IN R0.1 ?D2?, D11_1, D10, D10_1, D11 and D11_2 are likely botched. Check them against MC33816 R0.2 layout. dual package into one package
 8) RESOLVED IN R0.1 D9 is likely botched, wrong footprint pins, verify against MC33816 R0.2 layout. 
 9)                  Update BoostV indicator LED per https://rusefi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1337&start=75
10)                  terminals usability is asking for improvements. Ideally can we move more terminals to the edge of the board?
11)                  migrate to lower profile capacitors anticipating future case
12)                  silkscreen not hidden under headers
