1) RESOLVED IN R0.2 DPAK2 is apparently different than D2PAK, now it uses TO-263AB
2) RESOLVED IN R0.2 Make vias under large GND pad larger to allow more heat form iron during soldering
3) RESOLVED IN R0.2 move Via's to PCB edge to allow install on proto area of Frankenso
4) RESOLVED IN R0.2 add 4-40 mounting screw hole(s)
5)                  signal wire hole to be a bit bigger - bottom-left on https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rusefi/rusefi/master/hardware/DDPAK_breakout/BTS2140.jpg
