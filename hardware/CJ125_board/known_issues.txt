 1) RESOLVED IN R0.2 SOIC24 wrong size
 2) RESOLVED IN R0.2 Q1 MOSFET is not connected properly. 
 3) RESOLVED IN R0.3 DIAHD silkscreen on pad #6 should be DIAHG
 4) RESOLVED IN R0.3 add a note describing UR (R8) and UA (R15) low pass filter / slew rate limiter
 5) RESOLVED IN R0.3 Correct C9 should match C2 for 1kHz low pass filter. 
 6) RESOLVED IN R0.3 R12 is not routed right
 7) RESOLVED IN R0.3 voltage divider on UR and UA channels, 5V --> 3V (not clear if we need this on the little board - we can always use external divider)
 8) RESOLVED IN R0.3 R3 is now 0R and C3 is now DNP. These are here incase a filter is needed, as shown in some of the OEM's documentation. 
 9)                  enlarge silkscreen font - current font is too small
10)                  match Frankenso GND/3v/5v pinout
11) RESOLVED IN R0.3 provide 4 extra holes in corners just for flat mounting
12) RESOLVED IN R0.3 power ON status LED, heater intensity LED
13) RESOLVED IN R0.4 Change solder mask, from 0.007874015748 to 0.003.
