 * @brief   software PWM generator
 *
 * Software PWM implementation. Considering how low all frequencies are, we can totally afford a couple of float multiplications.
 * By generating PWM programmatically we are saving the timers for better purposes. This implementation also supports generating
 * synchronized waves as needed for example to emulate dual Hall-effect crankshaft position sensors.
