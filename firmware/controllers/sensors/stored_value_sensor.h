/**
 * @brief Base class for sensors that compute a value on one thread, and want
 * to make it available to consumers asynchronously.
 *
 * Common examples include sensors that have to do heavy lifting to produce
 * a reading, and don't want to perform that conversion at the time of
 * consumption.
 *
 * To use this class, create a class for your sensor that inherits StoredValueSensor,
 * and call Invalidate() and SetValidValue(float) as appropriate when readings are available
 * (or known to be invalid) for your sensor.
 *
 * Consumers will retrieve the last set (or invalidated) value.
